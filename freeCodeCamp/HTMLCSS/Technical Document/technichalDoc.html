              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
              describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
              (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS
              describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in
              speech, or on other media. CSS is among the core languages of the
              open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
              specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of
              CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the
              versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard
              about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a
              CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.
              After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased
              significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to
              differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and
              release recommendations separately per module. Instead of
              versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a
              snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and
              individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers,
              or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.

              Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
              language either. CSS is the code that styles web content. We'll
              answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make
              content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How
              do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors? CSS is
              what you use to selectively style HTML elements.

        <!-- RULESET -->

            <p>
              Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand
              how it works:
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <pre>
              <code>

        p { 
          color: red;        
        }
              </code>
            </pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term
              <em>ruleset</em> is often referred to as just <em>rule</em>.) Note
              the names of the individual parts:
            </p>

            <p>
              This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It
              defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example,
              <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
              elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a single rule like <code>color: red;</code>. It specifies
              which of the element's properties you want to style.
            </p>

            <p>
              These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this
              example, <code>color</code> is a property of the
              <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
              elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect
              in the rule.
            </p>

            <p>
              To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property
              value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a
              given property. (For example, there are many
              <code>color</code> values in addition to <code>red</code>.)
            </p>

            <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly
                braces. (<code>{}</code>)
              </li>

              <li>
                Within each declaration, you must use a colon (<code>:</code>)
                to separate the property from its value or values.
              </li>

              <li>
                Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (<code>;</code>)
                to separate each declaration from the next one.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them
              separated by semicolons, like this:
            </p>

            <div class="code-block">
              <pre>
              <code>

        p {
          color : red;
          width : 500px;
          border : 1px solid black;        
        }
              </code>
            </pre>
            </div>
          </article>

          <article>
            <p>
              When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's
              content with its style information. It processes the document in a
              number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this
              is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads
              a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in
              different ways. But this is roughly what happens.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).
              </li>
              <li>
                It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM
                represents the document in the computer's memory. The DOM is
                explained in a bit more detail in the next section.
              </li>
              <li>
                The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked
                to by the HTML document, such as embedded images, videos, and
                even linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the
                process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.
              </li>
              <li>
                The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different
                rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g.
                element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds,
                it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the
                DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate
                step is called a render tree).
              </li>
              <li>
                The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in
                after the rules have been applied to it.
              </li>
              <li>
                The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this
                stage is called painting).
              </li>
            </ul>
